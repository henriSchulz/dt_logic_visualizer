# DT-Visualisierer

This project was developed for the Institut für Technik der Informationsverarbeitung (ITIV) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT) as part of the course "Digitaltechnik".

## Overview

DT-Visualisierer is a web-based tool designed to help students and instructors visualize and interact with digital logic concepts, such as Boolean functions, multiplexers and truth tables. The application provides an intuitive interface for exploring digital circuits and their properties, including symmetry analysis.

## Features

- Visualization of Boolean functions and truth tables
- Interactive multiplexers and logic circuit components
- Symmetry analysis tools
- User-friendly UI for educational purposes

## Usage

Open `index.html` in your browser to start the application. All logic and UI components are located in the `src/` directory, with assets and styles in the `assets/` folder.

## Folder Structure

- `index.html` – Main entry point
- `src/` – Source code (logic, UI, utilities)
- `assets/` – Images, logos, and CSS files
- `tests/` – Test scripts

## Documentation

- `doc/` – Documentation files
  - `customFunctionSyntax.md` – Syntax for custom functions
  - `symmetryMapperFunction.md` – Explanation of the symmetry mapper function

## Requirements

No installation is required. The application runs entirely in the browser.

## License

This project is intended for educational use at KIT / ITIV.
